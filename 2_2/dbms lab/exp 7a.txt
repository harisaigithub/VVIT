  function get_student (student_id number) return student%rowtype;
end;
/

create or replace package body student_info_system as

    :student_id_label.text := student_record.student_id;
    :first_name_label.text := student_record.first_name;

Explanation: 

This code creates a form that displays the information for a student. The form has five labels: student ID, first name, last name, email, and phone number. The form also has a button that allows the user to update the student information. When the user clicks the button, the form calls the get_student function to get the student information from the database. The form then displays the student information on the form.
